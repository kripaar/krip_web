# krip_web
 
This is the website framework module made by the kripaars.<br>
Not to say Djago and Flask are bad, but they really have pros and cons.

So... I tried to make a framework for probably my own use, that basically patches all those problems.

Sounds a crazily large project, isn't it?

Currently, I'm working on it. More and more features and patches will be there.

# Examples
No don't think about that rn cuz there's too few features to say.<br>
I'll make them when I think it's time and feel like it.
