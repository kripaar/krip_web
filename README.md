# krip_web
 
This is the website framework module made by the kripaars <br>
Not to say Djago and Flask are bad, but they really have pros and cons.

So... I tried to make a framework for probably my own use, that basically patches all those problems.

Sounds a crazily large project, isn't it?

Currently I'm working on it. More and more features and patches will be there.
